# CDP-Project

CDP stands for CIC Development Platform (CDP)

## Project Overview

> The CDP Project aims to streamline the entire CIC workflow—starting from a simple 2-page project brief—by automatically generating:
> 1. A complete AWS architecture diagram  
> 2. Technical documentation (including component descriptions, deployment steps, and API specifications)  
> 3. Infrastructure-as-Code (both CDK and CloudFormation)  
> 4. A cost estimate for all AWS services involved  
>
> By automating each of these steps, we drastically reduce the time and manual effort required to spin up new CIC initiatives. Contributors simply supply a short project summary, and the CDP engine produces production-ready IaC artifacts, documentation, and budgeting in one go—freeing up teams to focus on business logic instead of repetitive setup tasks.  
>
> This “from-doc-to-deployment” pipeline boosts productivity, enforces consistent best practices, and accelerates the delivery of cloud-native solutions.
